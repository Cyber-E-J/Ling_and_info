We will begin by using the language contained in the transcripts to do basic queries.

    "## Using sklearn to get tf-idf vectors\n",
    "On the last assignment, we used an inverted index to quickly compute queries by taking advantage of the sparsity of tf-idf vectors in our vector space. However, the dataset we are considering for this assignment is small enough such that we can use explicit vectors, rather than an inverted index, to compute cosine similarities. We also will not be implementing tf-idf by hand -- we will be using an existing implementation from the library [sklearn,](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) which provides a lot of good implementations of machine learning algorithms in python. We will be making heavy use of this powerful library later in the semester, so using it to extract tfidf features is a good starting point!"

For each query, we consider all N-1 movies other than the query itself when computing the ranking. The label of each line is the ground truth query. \n",

In general, given more supervised data, one would compute aggregate precision/recall curves over a large number of ground truths.

However, we will be somewhat unorthodox here and plot one curve per query."

    "## Evaluating our rankings with Mean Average Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "While precision/recall curves are a good tool to visualize how well our rankings are performing, in some contexts, it is ideal to come up with a single number that characterizes how well our ranking system is doing over all ground-truth queries. A commonly used statistic for ranking systems is _Mean Average Precision_. To compute this value, first, one must compute the average precision for each query and subsequent ranking output by the system. Next, one averages these values. We've filled in functions for both `average_precision` and `mean_average_precision` for you. At the end of this section, run the provided code, which will give you a single number that evaluates the performance of each ranking system."
