    "You must completely this assignment **individually**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will be working with transcripts from the reality TV show \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" and cleaning the raw transcript data so that we may apply various layers of analysis in later assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment **is not intended to be a test of your programming skills**, but to get you familiar with the virtual environment and the structure of the data you will be analyzing. In fact, most of the code is provided and you only need to run through it and address two questions at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to help you to get comfortable working with the following tools / technologies / concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Jupyter Notebook environment\n",
    "* Recap of Python syntax and basic data structures\n",
    "* `virtualenv` or `venv` environment for package dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Integrity and Collaboration**\n",
    "\n",

    "All cells that contain the blocks that read `# YOUR CODE HERE` are editable and are to be completed to ensure you pass the test-cases. Make sure to write your code where indicated.\n",

    "You may use any number of notebook cells to explore the data and test out your functions, although you will only be graded on the solution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are unable to modify the read-only cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also use Markdown cells to explain your code and discuss your results when necessary.\n",

    "**Grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "For code-completion questions you will be graded on passing the public test cases we have included, as well as any hidden test cases that we have supplemented to ensure that your logic is correct.\n",

    "**Submission**\n",
