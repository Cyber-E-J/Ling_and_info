    "\n",
    "To complete your analysis print a bar graph that generalizes the relationship between pair interaction strength and similarity. For simplicity, we rate each pair's interaction strength \"high\", \"medium\", and \"low\" depending on how many interactions were exchanged between the pair:\n",
    "* High interaction strength: more than 500 interactions,\n",
    "* Medium interaction strength: 150 interactions to 500 interactions (inclusive),\n",
    "* Low interaction strength: less than 150 interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, categorize each pair into high, medium, or low interaction strength, and plot the average similarity of each category. That is, plot three bars on the x-axis (one for each category) against average similarity (for each category) on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Pairs of good speakers are bidirectional in this analysis and should be included only once. That is, if you've included (BRUCE, KRIS), you shouldn't include (KRIS, BRUCE). Also, do not include pairs between the same person (e.g. (KIM, KIM))\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `interaction_matrix` and `g_j_sim_matrix`."

    "\n",
    "<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)>Priming</a> is the phenomenon where a speaker tends to repeat certain words or language characteristics of the person they are replying to. It turns out that priming can often be observed in conversation. If A is talking to B, B will sometimes mirror A's language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color='blue'> Question 8a (code completion): Character priming matrix </font> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"8a\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis we will be looking at priming: i.e. when speaker B replies to speaker A, what is the probability that a word said by A will be repeated by B? \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, how many of the words in B's reply were also said by A (normalized by the number of words B said in total)?\n",
    "Specifically, consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Catelyn : Hi Ned, it is a really nice day today. Yes, it is.\n",
    "Ned : It is a really really nice day today. Yes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take the set of all words said by Catelyn: $W_c = \\{$hi, ned, it, is, a, really, nice, day, today, yes$\\}$, and the set of all words said by Ned: $W_n = \\{$it, is, a, really, nice, day, today, yes$\\}$, and perform the *priming computation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\left|W_c \\cap W_n\\right|}{\\left|W_n\\right|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific *ordered* pair of speakers A and B, we calculate the *arithmetic mean* of priming computations among all instances of B replying to A to get a single number between $0$ and $1$ as the answer to this question. That is, sum up the primed proportion for every B's reply to A and divide it by the number of times B replied to A.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next couple methods will walk you through necessary pre-computations to get this priming matrix.\n",
    "Do read through these functions carefully as you will be using their results."

My doctor told me I\\'m more likely to have bleeding or spotting between periods. This can be slight to a flow like a regular period and should decrease over time.

If you\\'ve ever had any of these conditions, certain cancers, or if you could be pregnant, you should not take the pill. The pill does not protect AGAINST H.I.V. OR S.T.D.s.

But if you chooseYAZ for birth control, it may also help treatmoderate acne and Premenstrual DysphoricDisorder, PMDD - not PMS. Unlike PMS, symptoms of PMDD are severe enough to interfere with your life. YAZ has a different type ofhormone that for some may increase potassium too much,so don't take YAZ if you have kidney,liver or adrenal disease because this could cause seriousheart and health problems. Tell your doctor if you'reon daily long term treatment for chronic conditions likecardiovascular or inflammatory diseases. Serious risks include bloodclots, stroke and heart attack. Smoking increases these risks,especially if you're over 35 so don't smokewhen taking YAZ. Don't take the Pill if you'vehad any of these, certain cancers,or could be pregnant. The Pill does not protectagainst HIV or STD's. Ask your healthcare providerabout YAZ.\"}]),\n",

Who says you have to have 12 periods a year on the pill? who says? .. did you know... Did you know that when you\\'re on a birth control pill, there is no medical need to have a monthly period? Like other birth control pills, seasoniqueis 99% effective. And youtake it every day. But instead of gettingyour period every month, you get it every 3 months. That\\'s 4 periods a year. My doctor told me I\\'m more likely to have bleeding or spotting between periods. This can be slight to a flow like a regular period and should decrease over time. Like other birth control pills, prescription seasonique has serious risks, including blood clot, stroke, and heart attack. Smoking increases these risks, especially if you\\'re over 35. If you\\'ve ever had any of these conditions, certain cancers, or if you could be pregnant, you should not take the pill. The pill does not protect AGAINST H.I.V. OR S.T.D.s. Get all the facts at seasonique.com. Who says \"that time of the month\" has to be every month? Who says? Who? who? Repunctuate your lifewith fewer periods. Ask for seasonique. good notes.
